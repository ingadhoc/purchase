Purchase Stock UX
=================

Several Improvements to purchases

On purchase orders:

#. Add delivery status on purchases
#. Add a to filter by PO with billable returns.

On purchase lines:

#. Add delivery status and invoice status on purchase lines
#. Add button on purchase lines to allow cancelling of remaining qty to be received
#. Add return quantity when you return products with "To Refund" option.

On incoming pickings:

#. Add button "Add Purchase Lines" to add moves from other pickings that are still pending.

On purchase invoices:

#. Add "add picking" functionlity on purchase invoices so picking lines that has some qty to be invoiced, is added to the invoice. This is different to "add PO" that add all lines no matter if they are to be invoiced or not. We keep this functionality because if a supplier send you an invoice of same lines that should be invoiced, you still have de possiblity to add them.

On Stock Moves:

#. Add button to access to purchase order related.
